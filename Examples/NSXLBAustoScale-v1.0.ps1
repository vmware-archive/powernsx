## NSX LB AutoScale
## Author: Dimitri Desmidt
## version 1.0
## August 2017

###
# This PowerShell script offers Auto Scaling of your application.
# Your application is running on servers ($VM_PrefixName + $VM_Clone_PrefixName)
# When those servers are heavily loaded ($CPU_Max or $RAM_Max) and are less than $VM_Max
#   The script deploys one new VM from vCenter template  ($VM_Template)
#   and adds that new VM in NSX LB Pool ($Edge_Name, $LB_Pool_Name)
# When those servers are lightly loaded ($CPU_Min or $RAM_Min) and more than $VM_Min,
#   The script removes one VM from NSX LB Pool ($Edge_Name, $LB_Pool_Name)
#   and removes that VM from vCenter
#
# Go to section "Define Variables for NSX LB AutoScale script" and enter your environment settings
#
###

# To allow the launch of that script in Windows Tasks "powershell.exe -file C:\NSXLBAustoScale-v1.0.ps1"
