########################################
# 1 - Connect to your NSX Manager
# 2 - Run the script and provide the path to the file containing the ruleids
#       ./BulkDeleteFwRules.ps1 ruleid.txt
# 3 - If the file contains ruleids that can be removed from the DFW, it will go
#     ahead and remove them, and save a copy of the config before any changes,
#     and also the config that is uploaded to the NSX Manager for future
#     reference.
# 4 - Sit back, have a drink, and reflect on what you just did and how long it
#     would have taken you to do manually.

This is a SAMPLE script that will bulk remove individual firewall rules from the
DFW based on a list of rule IDs provided in a text file.

It is intended to be an example of how to perform a certain action and may not
be suitable for all purposes.  Please read an understand its action and modify
as appropriate, or ensure its suitability for a given situation before blindly
running it.

Testing is limited to a lab environment.  Please test accordingly.

# to be deleted. The script expects a the file contain a single rule ID per line
$file = $args[0]
