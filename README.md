# PowerNSX

*A Powershell module for NSX for vSphere*

**[Get the latest news from the team at the PowerNSX blog](https://powernsx.github.io/blog/)**

PowerNSX is a PowerShell module that abstracts the VMware NSX API to a set of easily used PowerShell functions.

This module is not supported by VMware, and comes with no warranties express or implied. Please test and validate its functionality before using this product in a production environment.

It aims to focus on exposing New, Update, Remove and Get operations for all key NSX functions as well as adding additional functionality to extend the capabilities of NSX management beyond the native UI or API.

PowerNSX works closely with VMware PowerCLI, and PowerCLI users will feel quickly at home using PowerNSX.  Together these tools provide a comprehensive command line environment for managing your VMware NSX for vSphere environments.

PowerNSX is still a work in progress, and it is unlikely that it will ever expose 100% of the NSX API.  Feature requests are welcome via the [issues](https://github.com/vmware/powernsx/issues) tracker on the projects GitHub page.

PowerNSX now has experimental PowerShell Core support available in the master (development) branch.
Note that not all PowerNSX functions have been tested, and there are known issues (Remember, PowerShell Core and PowerCLI Core are both pre-release products as well.).  See [PowerNSX Core](https://powernsx.github.io/get-started#nsxinstallmacoslinux) for details.

## Installing PowerNSX

PowerNSX is available from the PowerShell Gallery.  Installation of PowerNSX from the PowerShell Gallery is performed as follows:

```
Find-Module PowerNSX | Install-Module -scope CurrentUser
```

If your system doesn't have PowerShell Gallery support, or you want to use the PowerNSX installation script, you can do so by running the oneliner below in a PowerShell Window. This will execute the PowerNSX installation script which will guide you through the installation of the latest stable release of PowerNSX.

```
$Branch="v3";$url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmware/powernsx/$Branch/PowerNSXInstaller.ps1"; try { $wc = new-object Net.WebClient;$scr = try { $wc.DownloadString($url)} catch { if ( $_.exception.innerexception -match "(407)") { $wc.proxy.credentials = Get-Credential -Message "Proxy Authentication Required"; $wc.DownloadString($url) } else { throw $_ }}; $scr | iex } catch { throw $_ }
```

PowerNSX can also be installed on PowerShell Core.   See [PowerNSX Core](https://powernsx.github.io/get-started#nsxinstallmacoslinux) for details.
