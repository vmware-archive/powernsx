PowerNSX Publishing Script

Because of the variety of ways of distributing and supporting both Core and
Desktop PowerShell as well as supportong both script based and PowerShell
gallery based installation with the same module, we need to have flexibility
in the way the manifest is built for various platforms.  This is pretty much
to do just with properly expressing the PowerCLI dependancies that PowerNSX has.

On top of that, the process of publishing updates to PowerShell Gallery and
PowerNSX versioning is now handled by it.

The intent is to have this script called by CI/CD when updates are PRs are
merged to PowerNSX.

See PowerNSX.psd1.README.md for instructions on this process and the
requirements for maintaining manifests now.

Maintainers are the only ones that should edit this script.
