            <p>PowerNSX is a PowerShell module that abstracts the VMware NSX API to a set of easily used PowerShell functions.</p>

            <p>This module is not supported by VMware, and comes with no warranties expressed or implied. Please test and validate its functionality before using in a production environment.</p>

            <p>PowerNSX aims to focus on exposing New, Update, Remove and Get operations for all key NSX functions as well as adding additional functionality to extend the capabilities of NSX management beyond the native UI or API.</p>

            <p>PowerNSX providers an interactive Command Line environment for NSX for vSphere. In conjunction with the Command Line environment, PowerNSX can be used to execute PowerShell scripts that allow the automation and creation of a vast array on tools.</p>

            <p>It is unlikely that it will ever expose 100% of the NSX API, but feature requests are welcomed if you find a particular function you require to be lacking. Currently PowerNSX covers the following key areas in depth:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>NSX Manager setup</li>
                <li>Host Preparation</li>
                <li>Logical Switching</li>
                <li>Logical Routing</li>
                <li>NSX Edge Gateway</li>
                <li>Distributed Firewall</li>
                <li>Service Composer</li>
                <li>NSX Edge Load Balancer</li>
                <li>NSX Edge SSL VPN</li>
            </ul>

            <p> Each area in the list above has a number of operations contained within.</p>
