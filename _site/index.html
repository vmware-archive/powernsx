<h1 id="a-powershell-module-for-nsx-for-vsphere">A Powershell module for NSX for vSphere</h1>

<p>PowerNSX is a PowerShell module that abstracts the VMware NSX API to a set of easily used PowerShell functions.</p>

<p>This module is not supported by VMware, and comes with no warranties express or implied. Please test and validate its functionality before using in a production environment.</p>

<p>It aims to focus on exposing New, Update, Remove and Get operations for all key NSX functions as well as adding additional functionality to extend the capabilities of NSX management beyond the native UI or API.</p>

<p>PowerNSX works closely with VMware PowerCLI, and PowerCLI users will feel quickly at home using PowerNSX.  Together these tools provide a comprehensive command line environment for managing your VMware NSX for vSphere environments.</p>

<p>PowerNSX is still a work in progress, and it is unlikely that it will ever expose 100% of the NSX API.  Feature requests are welcome via the issues tracker on the projects github page.</p>

<p>PowerNSX functionality covers the following key areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NSX Manager setup</li>
  <li>Host Preparation</li>
  <li>Logical Switching</li>
  <li>Logical Routing</li>
  <li>NSX Edge Gateway</li>
  <li>Dynamic Routing</li>
  <li>Distributed Firewall</li>
  <li>Service Composer</li>
  <li>NSX Edge Load Balancer</li>
  <li>NSX Edge SSL VPN</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="is-powernsx-supported">Is PowerNSX supported?</h1>

<p>This module is <em>not supported</em> by VMware, and comes with no warranties express or implied.  Please test and validate its functionality before using in a production environment.</p>

<p>Whist every endeavor is made to test functionality it is recommended that tools and scripts created with PowerNSX be validated and tested before using in production.</p>
